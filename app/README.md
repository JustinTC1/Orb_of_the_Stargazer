## Themes of the game

_What is the game about? Explain here!_

You are a magic scholar sent from the Mage's guild to retrieve a magical artifact called "The Orb of the First Stargazer." This orb has been rumoured
to hold infinite knowledge and will be of great use in solving the famine problems in your homeland. On your travels you will meet various people who
will help you uncover the mysteries of where this orb is located and the darker secrets behind its power. Though most are willing to help, there is
one person who will make it much harder for you to succeed - an egotistical wizard from a rival guild who also wants the orb. 

## Plan for narrative development

_How are you going to explain the narrative of the game? How will the player explore the environment, and what can they learn by doing so?_

The majority of the narrative will be explained through the dialogue between you and the characters you meet along the way. This dialogue will also point you in 
the right direction and will lead you to different parts of the map. You will go from the dock to a cave and then to a village where you will meet most of the other
interactable characters that will push the narrative forward. Signposts will also be located throughout the environments to give you information.

Progression is locked behind dialogue and dialogue changes as you progress, giving the characters individuality.

Controls:
WASD/Arrow Keys - Move player
E/Enter/Space - Interact with players and signs

## With additional time and resources, what would you add to the game?

With the additional time and resources we could spend more time on the artwork, making sure everything looks cohesive and work a bit more on the colour scheme to make it
clearer as to what time of day it is. We could also edit the textures so that they blend together slightly better for example, in the caves and the docks you can clearly see the
square outlines of the tiles. We could also continue the story and have you duel with the rival wizard and actually obtain the orb at the end. We could also add some lore
panels for more context and a title screen.
